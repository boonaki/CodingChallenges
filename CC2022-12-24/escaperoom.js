// You are creating an "Escape the room" game. The first step is to create a hash table called rooms that contains all of the rooms of the game. There should be at least 3 rooms inside it, each being a hash table with at least three properties (e.g. name, description, completed).

//create an object hash table, with 3 objects as values, and the props of that being 'name', 'description' and 'completed'
var rooms = {
    1: {
        'name': '',
        'description': '',
        'completed': '',
    },
    2: {
        'name': '',
        'description': '',
        'completed': '',
    },
    3: {
        'name': '',
        'description': '',
        'completed': '',
    }
}

console.log(rooms)
