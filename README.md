## How It's Done:

After finding a challenge, I go through a process called PREP, whether it is on paper or in my IDE, and solve the challenge given, with test cases to see results. After solutions are confirmed, the program is then pushed to this repository via the command line.

## Lessons Learned:

Coding is fun.
